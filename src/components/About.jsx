          I'm currently an Engineer at <b>Tata Consultancy Services</b>,
          building things for the web with some awesome people.<br/><br/>
          I graduated from <b>Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology</b>.<br/><br/>
          As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between
          engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge
          with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product.<br/><br/>
          My goal is to always build web applications that are scalable
          and efficient under the hood while providing engaging,
          pixel-perfect user experiences.
